              It's taken us a long time to understand the meaning of the quote
              by Ralph Waldo Emerson 'Life is a journey, not a destination'. We
              are not meant to rush through life. It's about savouring every
              moment of each day. It's about how we learn the lessons along the
              way. It's about learning what self-care is all about.

              At RBF we believe in SHARING HAPPINESS. The joy of giving
              certainly has a lot to give back! Peace, happiness, smile - these
              are some of the instant returns of giving. Giving means helping in
              a way, which ultimately makes us recall the simplest meaning of
              humanity â€œWhoever saves one life, saves the world entire - Thomas
              Keneally.
